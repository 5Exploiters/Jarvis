## Features
### Speech Impediment
Approximately 7.5 million people have a speech impediment that impairs their ability to express themselves and communivate effectively. American sign language can be a hard skill to learn and requires both parties to know the language. With our product, a text-to-speech api, and a speaker, one can type in midair, and immediately the words will be said out loud allowing easy communication.
### Virtual Reality
Currently users of virtual reality must pick letters individually when typing. With LOTR, users are able to type with a fully immersive glove. This increases effieciency and speed.
### IOT Home
A Raspberry Pi consolidates the data from all the accelerometrs. This data can be sent over wifi or bluetooth to various apis. For instance, it could be used to control a home using Lutron, call a ride using Lyft, or order food using Seamless. The possibilities are endless.
